# BIG-IQ Collector

## Description

The `bigIQCollect.sh` script must be copied and run on a BIG-IQ Centralized Manager instance. It will collect raw JSON files and package them into a single .tgz file:
the .tgz file can then be processed offline by Second Sight to build all target JSON files

`sampledata.tgz` is provided for testing purposes

## Script installation

- Copy (scp) `bigIQCollect.sh` from your local host to your BIG-IQ CM instance, under `/tmp/`

```
$ scp bigIQCollect.sh root@bigiq.f5:/tmp/

$ 
```

- SSH to your BIG-IQ CM instance and run the collection script with no parameters to display the help banner

```
